**Scenario:**

Develop a product page for a fictional e-commerce website. The product information will be fetched from an API endpoint.

You can use this design or any other that you want to use :

**Requirements:**

- **Frontend (NextJS & ReactJS):**
  - Create a React component for the product page.
  - Utilize NextJS functionalities like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps to fetch product data from the sample JSON file in the repository.
  - Display the product details on the page, including name, description, price, image, and other relevant information.
  - Implement basic user interaction features like adding the product to a cart (simulated functionality, no backend integration required).
  - Consider using a state management solution (Redux, Context API) to manage product data and cart state (optional).
  - Style the product page using CSS or a styling library like Bootstrap or Material UI.

**Bonus points:**

- Implement a product image carousel to showcase multiple product images.
- Allow users to select different product variants (e.g., size, color) before adding to cart.
- Integrate with a payment gateway API (simulated functionality) for a complete checkout experience (advanced).
- Implement user reviews and ratings functionality (advanced).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Code quality, structure, and maintainability (use of NextJS conventions and React best practices).
- Understanding of data fetching techniques in NextJS (e.g., getStaticProps, getServerSideProps).
- Effective use of components and state management for data handling.
- User interface design, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
- Ability to complete the challenge within a reasonable timeframe (consider complexity and experience level).

**Additional Notes:**

- You are welcome to use any additional libraries or packages that you find helpful for the project (e.g., Axios for API calls).
- While a fully functional e-commerce system is not required, demonstrating the core functionalities of a product page is sufficient.
